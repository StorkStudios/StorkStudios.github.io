      <description>Hi! After a little summer break we are back to technical posts. As you may have guessed from the title, today I will show you around the animation system in Bullet Waste. I will tell a bit of backstory, explain the design goals and how we managed to fulfill them.&#xA;Animations don&amp;#39;t always work as expected&#xD;Handling animations in Unity is one of these things that are easy to begin with, but tend to get harder as your project develops.</description>

      <description>Storks, games and pigeons A few weeks ago, I spotted a US government spy drone pigeon trying to build a nest on my balcony. Personally, I don’t really mind these flying rats as long as they keep their distance, but this one really crossed the line.

      <description>Knowledge is power Video games are all about having fun. As a developer, you want your players to have a good time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a crane operator simulator or a fast-paced shooter. You need to create an experience that people will like. The problem is, as the creator you are not a player, at least not a regular one. Your opinion on your game&amp;rsquo;s features and balance is heavily biased by your experience.</description>

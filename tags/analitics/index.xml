      <description>Knowledge is power Video games are all about having fun. As a developer, you want your players to have a good time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a crane operator simulator or a fast-paced shooter. You need to create an experience that people will like. The problem is, as the creator you are not a player, at least not a regular one. Your opinion on your game&amp;rsquo;s features and balance is heavily biased by your experience.</description>

      <description>This post is about several GameJams that we attended recently.&#xA;0h GameJam on the tram Remember My summer internship at a local nuclear reactor? So the best 3 teams at the GameJam got a free Indie Pass for the Game Industry Conference. We were tied for the 2nd place so lucky us, huh? Either way, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we were there. But this year was different. The event fell on the daylight saving time day in Poland where we enter the winter time by moving our clocks by one hour back when the clock hits 3:00am.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Adam “Gahlammon” Dachtera, team leader and main designer of the Bullet Waste, here to tell you about the event we&amp;rsquo;ve attended lately.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s go!

It stands for Zespołowe Tworzenie Gier Komputerowych (Collaborative Development of Computer Games). It&amp;rsquo;s a competition in Łódź that takes place once a year at the end of June.</description>

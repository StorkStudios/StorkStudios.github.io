      <description>This post is about several GameJams that we attended recently.&#xA;0h GameJam on the tram Remember My summer internship at a local nuclear reactor? So the best 3 teams at the GameJam got a free Indie Pass for the Game Industry Conference. We were tied for the 2nd place so lucky us, huh? Either way, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we were there. But this year was different. The event fell on the daylight saving time day in Poland where we enter the winter time by moving our clocks by one hour back when the clock hits 3:00am.</description>

      <description>Hi! After a little summer break we are back to technical posts. As you may have guessed from the title, today I will show you around the animation system in Bullet Waste. I will tell a bit of backstory, explain the design goals and how we managed to fulfill them.&#xA;Animations don&amp;#39;t always work as expected&#xD;Handling animations in Unity is one of these things that are easy to begin with, but tend to get harder as your project develops.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Adam “Gahlammon” Dachtera, team leader and main designer of Bullet Waste, here to tell you about the designing of our game.&#xA;Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re currently approaching the release of the third demo of Bullet Waste. It will bring many changes to the core of our gameplay, for example a big rework of combat and arena structure. It will also introduce new enemies, new environments and reimagined training sequence, so there&amp;rsquo;s surely something to look out for.</description>

      <description>Knowledge is power Video games are all about having fun. As a developer, you want your players to have a good time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a crane operator simulator or a fast-paced shooter. You need to create an experience that people will like. The problem is, as the creator you are not a player, at least not a regular one. Your opinion on your game&amp;rsquo;s features and balance is heavily biased by your experience.</description>

      <description>Why As you may know Bullet Waste is a first-person bullet-hell game, which means spawning a lot of bullets at runtime. Furthermore, a game designer needs to be able to define complicated attacks with ease. This task was assigned to me and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a pretty interesting solution.&#xA;But how to tackle this This problem (as many others) consists of many smaller ones. But for the sake of this article lets focus on the main two:</description>

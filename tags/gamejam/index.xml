      <description>This post is about several GameJams that we attended recently.&#xA;0h GameJam on the tram Remember My summer internship at a local nuclear reactor? So the best 3 teams at the GameJam got a free Indie Pass for the Game Industry Conference. We were tied for the 2nd place so lucky us, huh? Either way, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we were there. But this year was different. The event fell on the daylight saving time day in Poland where we enter the winter time by moving our clocks by one hour back when the clock hits 3:00am.</description>

The event lasted approximately 30 hours (10:00 through 16:00 on the next day). There were multiple sites at which you could attend the jam which included:&#xA;Helsinki XR Center Game Habitat&amp;rsquo;s DevHub at Malmo Poznan University of Technology DE:HIVE at Berlin The onboarding consisted of two presentations.</description>

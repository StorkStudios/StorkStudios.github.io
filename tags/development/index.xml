      <description>Hi, I’m Adam “Gahlammon” Dachtera, team leader and main designer of Bullet Waste, here to tell you about the design process of our enemies.&#xA;&amp;hellip;um, I mean, enemies in Bullet Waste. Not enemies of Stork&amp;rsquo;Studios. Just to be clear.&#xA;Ma Meilleure Ennemie If you had played one of our demos, you would have noticed that there was only one type of enemy. That is, if our demo hadn&amp;rsquo;t crushed you into powder before you would have reached one of them, of course.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Adam “Gahlammon” Dachtera, team leader and main designer of Bullet Waste, here to tell you about the designing of our game.&#xA;Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re currently approaching the release of the third demo of Bullet Waste. It will bring many changes to the core of our gameplay, for example a big rework of combat and arena structure. It will also introduce new enemies, new environments and reimagined training sequence, so there&amp;rsquo;s surely something to look out for.</description>

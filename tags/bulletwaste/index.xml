      <description>Hi! After a little summer break we are back to technical posts. As you may have guessed from the title, today I will show you around the animation system in Bullet Waste. I will tell a bit of backstory, explain the design goals and how we managed to fulfill them.&#xA;Animations don&amp;#39;t always work as expected&#xD;Handling animations in Unity is one of these things that are easy to begin with, but tend to get harder as your project develops.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Adam “Gahlammon” Dachtera, team leader and main designer of the Bullet Waste, here to tell you about the event we&amp;rsquo;ve attended lately.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s go!

      <description>Knowledge is power Video games are all about having fun. As a developer, you want your players to have a good time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a crane operator simulator or a fast-paced shooter. You need to create an experience that people will like. The problem is, as the creator you are not a player, at least not a regular one. Your opinion on your game&amp;rsquo;s features and balance is heavily biased by your experience.</description>

      <description>Why As you may know Bullet Waste is a first-person bullet-hell game, which means spawning a lot of bullets at runtime. Furthermore, a game designer needs to be able to define complicated attacks with ease. This task was assigned to me and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a pretty interesting solution.&#xA;But how to tackle this This problem (as many others) consists of many smaller ones. But for the sake of this article lets focus on the main two:</description>

      <description>Hello There In this post I want to share some stories and thoughts from the XR GameJam which we, the Stork&amp;rsquo;Studios, attended recently (30-31.05.2024).&#xA;About XR GameJam The premise of this GameJam was to make a XR/VR game. The event lasted approximately 30 hours (10:00 through 16:00 on the next day). There were multiple sites at which you could attend the jam which included:&#xA;Helsinki XR Center Game Habitat&amp;rsquo;s DevHub at Malmo Poznan University of Technology DE:HIVE at Berlin The onboarding consisted of two presentations.</description>

      <description>Knowledge is power Video games are all about having fun. As a developer, you want your players to have a good time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a crane operator simulator or a fast-paced shooter. You need to create an experience that people will like. The problem is, as the creator you are not a player, at least not a regular one. Your opinion on your game&amp;rsquo;s features and balance is heavily biased by your experience.</description>

      <description>Why As you may know Bullet Waste is a first-person bullet-hell game, which means spawning a lot of bullets at runtime. Furthermore, a game designer needs to be able to define complicated attacks with ease. This task was assigned to me and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a pretty interesting solution.&#xA;But how to tackle this This problem (as many others) consists of many smaller ones. But for the sake of this article lets focus on the main two:</description>
